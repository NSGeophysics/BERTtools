* How to "uncrinkle" a line of 3D coordinates

(calculate profile coordinates based on incremental distances between
the electrodes)

1) Download the Matlab function Pos3dToLine.m from
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NSGeophysics/GPStools/master/Pos3dToLine.m

2) create an N x 3 matrix named "positions" containing the x-coords in
the first column, the y-coords in the second column, the z-coords in
the third column.

Run

profile=Pos3dToLine(positions);

3) The first column of "profile" will be the along-profile
coordinates, the second column are the elevations.




* How to project a crooked linear arrangements of electrodes onto a line:

1) Download
https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/16800-orthogonal-linear-regression

and

https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/7844-geom2d/content/geom2d/geom2d/projPointOnLine.m


2) Set xp the x-positions of your electrodes and yp the y-positions of your electrodes.

3) Get the polynomial fit
p=linortfit2(xp,yp)

4) Project points onto line
pts=projPointOnLine([xp(:) yp(:)], [0 p(2) 1 p(1)]);

5) Set the first point as zero and calculate distance
ref=1; % Reference electrode
elecs=pts-repmat(pts(ref,:),length(pts),1);
xnew=sqrt(elecs(:,1).^2+elecs(:,2).^2);

6) Find new topography for the points: set topodata=[topodatx topodaty topodatz];
znew=griddata(topodata(:,1),topodata(:,2),topodata(:,3),pts(:,1),pts(:,2));

7) Write out new coordinates
dlmwrite('xycoords2d.txt',[xnew znew],'\t')
